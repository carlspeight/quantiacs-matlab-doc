Submitting a System
===================

To submit your trading system to the Quantiacs marketplace simply click the button ‘Submit Trading System’ in the upper right of the evaluation GUI. This redirects you to the website where you can set the name for your system and hit the submit button.

You can also submit your system via the command window. Simply type:

``submit('Trading_System_file', 'system_name')``

Here, 'Trading_System_file' is the name of the .m file in the Current Folder. 'system_name' is the name you'd like to give the system on the marketplace. You will be prompted to log in to complete the upload.

Alternatively, you can upload a tradingsystem via the Upload button on the Website. You will be prompted to log in to complete the upload.
